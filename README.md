This repo contains the Fluxus installer as well as common fixes.

# Common Issues
## 1. System.BadImageFormatException
   First, make sure your anti virus is disabled. Once confirmed, restart Fluxus.
   If it persists, install both the exes below and restart their computer.
   1. https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
   2. https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe

## 2. Object reference is not set
   This means you're unable to use the regular UI. 
   First,  go to your Fluxus bin folder and locate Fluxus Lite. You have to use Fluxus Lite.
  
## 3. Unexpected Client Behavior (Code 268)
   Close ROBLOX. Then, download and open the exe [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/905154446705709129/954108995445076028/268_kick_fixer.zip).

## 4. Inject Fluxus before executing
   * MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING THE WEB ROBLOX AND NOT THE MICROSOFT VERSION
   * 
   This means Fluxus is not injected. Firstly, make sure attempted to inject in the first place.
If you clicked the inject button and it still says it, wait a minute (Injection speed depends on computer hardware)
If nothing happens or a console quickly opens and closes, you have an active anti virus. Make sure all your anti virus is disabled and then reinstall Fluxus.
If the error continues after this, your anti virus or another third party software is interfering with the injection process. 

You can ensure all the Fluxus files are present by going to:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Fluxus

Ensure that folder has all these files:
If it does not after a reinstall, an anti virus or third party is deleting it.
